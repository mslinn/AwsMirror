You first nee to run the program with the `auth` option so it can create a file in your home directory called `.aws` to
hold your AWS access key and your AWS secret key.
You can store multiple authentications for each of the AWS accounts that you work with.

````
[{"awsAccountName":"memyselfi",
  "accessKey":"BLAHBLAH",
  "secretKey":"BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH"}]
````

## Working with aws ##
The `.aws` file in your home directory contains authentication information, stored as JSON, for all AWS accounts
that you work with.
An `.s3` file defines the root of a source directory tree, and stores the account and bucket that the source directory
tree is associated with. It also stores the timestamp of the last sync. Its format is also JSON.
